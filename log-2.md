# 100 Days Of Code V2- Log

[Having completed a 100DaysOfCode Challenge a few months back I've decided to begin a 100 days of code challenge again! 
I found myself much more consistent when taking part in the challenge, and so here we are again.]

### Day 1: November 05, 2022 
### The Odin Project [CONTINUATION]

##### Having completed the foundation section of The Odin Project, as seen in the first log.md, the course then allowed me continue on with a specific full-stack JavaScript course. 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with The Odin Project course, I am currently within the Intermediate CSS section which has covered important topics such as advanced selectors, positioning, functions and now forms. Having completed all of the above so far, I was tasked with copying a website layout including a form to the best of my ability. I am about finished with the project except for the JavaScript functionality which I will be adding tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I was quite excited to begin a new project using mostly CSS and HTML again as I had recently spent a significant amount of time using both for a previous, large project. However, embarrassingly, I found myself staring blankly at the screen wondering just how I was going to copy the website example I had been provided with. Whilst building the site, I attempted to use as many newly-learned pieces of code as I code, which I think I could have done better with, but I'm content nonetheless. Mostly, I used more specific selectors rather than giving every single element a class as I had done in the past. This reduced the amount of classes I'd normally use significantly and made it easier to navigate my code. I also used positioning whilst now actually understanding why I achieved a certain result! For example, I had 2 divs, one left, one right. I attempted to position an 'absolute' element in the left div that would use 100% width, but instead it would span across both divs. I fixed this as I had remembered that the parent element, the left div in this case, must be set to a position of 'relative' before the absolute-positioned element can use the left div as a parent element. Overall, I'm very happy with the project result so far, I will be continuing tomorrow with the JavaScript functionality.
