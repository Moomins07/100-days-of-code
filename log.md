# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Having completed a variety of exercises from various different courses over the last few months, I have decided to begin a JavaScript Udemy course from scratch and it is my goal to complete the course in it's entirety by the end of my 100days-of-code challenge. I believe that, by doing so, I will not only streamline my learning experience, but I will also set myself a clear goal/path that is realistic within the time frame that I have set. I am coding along with my lecturer, taking notes and completing ALL of the coding challenges presented to me in the course. You can find my notes and follow-along code here: https://github.com/Moomins07/udemy-course-notes.

### Day 1: January 30, 2022 
### 01-Fundamentals-Part-1 [START]

**Today's Progress**: I completed 6-11 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. This took approximately 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts:** I have covered a lot of the basic fundamentals of JS before, however, this particular course went into much greater detail and filled in a few smaller knowledge gaps. I now have a greater understanding of JavaScript overall, including its origin, terminology such as the use of 'value', ES6 and what is considered 'modern JS'.


### Day 2: January 31, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I completed 12-16 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered data types, variables, basic operators, operator precedence and I also completed a coding challenge (#1) that entailed the use of all of the previously mentioned fundamentals. This took approximately 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Once again this particular course went into much greater detail on subjects/fundamentals I thought I already had an adequate understanding of and filled in smaller knowledge gaps I was unaware of. For example, |typeof null| returning |object| as opposed to |null| in the same way that |typeof undefined| returns |undefined|.


### Day 3: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 17-19 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered strings and template literals, if...else statements and a coding challenge (#2) that entailed the use of all of the previously mentioned fundamentals. This took approximately 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: Having covered string template literals and if...else statements in a previous course, I did not have any issues with these sub-sections. I did however learn that template literal strings can break/use multiple lines by simply using return, as opposed to using \n\. I will be using backtick quotes (`) for all of my strings from now on.


### Day 4: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 20-22 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered type conversion/coercion, truthy and falsy values and equality operators. This took approximately 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have studied these subjects briefly in a previous course and I did not have any trouble. I feel that I have further developed my understanding in all 3 subjects. However, loose equality operators are still somewhat of a grey area with room for improvement.

### Day 5: February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 23-25 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered boolean logic, logical operators and a coding challenge (#3) that entailed the use of all 3 subjects. This took approximately 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have covered boolean logic and logical opperators briefly in a previous course. I did not struggle with either subject and completed the coding challenge plus bonus challenges with little trouble, in good time, and also with final code very similar to my lecturer's. I believe that I have a good understanding of both subjects. I would like to further research common circumstances in which the NOT (!) operator is used.


### Day 6: February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 26-27 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered switch statements and statements & expressions. I re-wrote a switch statement as an if...else statement as a coding challenge. This took approximately 1.5 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have covered switch statements briefly in a previous course and I had little trouble with the coding challenge, completing it in good time. I was not entirely clear on the differences between statements and expressions and I found it to be a grey area before the lecture. However, I feel confident that I now have a greater understanding of both subjects.


### Day 7: February 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 28-30 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered ternary operators, a coding challenge putting ternary operators into practice and finally a history on JavaScript including a brief explanation of transpiling and polyfilling. Specifically, the coding challenge entailed the use of a ternary operator and recalling the value in a template literal. I have completed Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. This took approximately 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: Ternary operators are relatively new to me as I don't recall spending a significant amount of time on the subject in a previous course. However, I did not have any issues with following the lecture or completing the coding challenge. I found Section 30 on the history of JavaScript very interesting as I was not aware of its origin until today.

### 01-Fundamentals-Part-1 [COMPLETE]


### Day 8: February 6, 2022 
### 01-Fundamentals-Part-2 [START]

**Today's Progress**: My hour today was spent setting up the relevant files and completing subsection 32, 'activating strict mode' (first lecture of Fundamentals part 2) in which I learned about the benefits of using strict mode in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** All files and working environment is now prepared for the entirety of Fundamentals part 2. Activating strict mode in JavaScript is simple and hlds many benefits with very little downside to its use. I will be using strict mode for all of my scripts from now on.


### Day 9: February 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 50% of sub-section 33 of Section 3: Fundamentals - Part 2 on Functions. I've taken relevant notes and written a basic function that returns data to the console.

**Thoughts**: Even having only completed 50% of the first lecture on functions, I feel that I have already clarified various grey areas and developed a better understanding. However, the function lectures are siginificantly longer than previous subsection lectures.


### Day 10: February 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-section 33 of Section 3: Fundamentals - Part 2 on Functions. I've also started Function declarations vs Function expressons. I've taken relevant notes and written a basic function that returns data to the console.

**Thoughts**: After the completion of the lecture on functions, I feel much more confident and knowledgeable on the subject, enough so to continue forward with the course. However, I would definitely like to supplement my knowledge on functions further to concrete that knowledge.


### (Visiting family Feb 9 - Feb 21)


### Day 11: February 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-section 34 of Section 3: Fundamentals - Part 2 on Functions. Function declarations vs Function expressons completed.

**Thoughts**: I now know the difference between declarations and expressions as well as circumstances in which one may be more useful than the other.


### Day 12: February 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today was mostly a recap of previous lessons under Section 3 to re-familiarise myself after a long break. I also completed sub-section 35 'arrow functions'.

**Thoughts**: A lesson re-cap felt necessary and I also feel that I will likely re-cap more previous lessons under Section 2. I am not entirely confident on arrow functions yet, I will further research the topic and re-cap the lesson again tomorrow.


### Day 13: February 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed sub-sections 36-37 of Section 3 Fundamentals part 2. The topics covered were Functions calling other functions and reviewing functions.

**Thoughts**: I feel much more confident in my ability to use and understand functions. However, I certainly feel that I could further develop that knowledge and understanding.


### Day 14: February 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: As mentioned in yesterday's thought's log, I decided to spend today re-capping 'reviewing functions' and properly updating my notes on that lesson.

**Thoughts**: I feel that I have in fact further developed my knowledge on functions and now also have very useful notes that I can refer back to if need be.


### Day 15: February 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed the first coding challenge of Section 3 Fundamentals part 2. In the challenge, I was required to create multiple functions to fulfil certain tasks. This included using arrow functions, functions expressions, functins within functions and also an if-else statement. 

**Thoughts**: Having finally put the knowledge and studying to use has greatly increased my confidence in the use of functions. I feel condfident moving on.


### Day 16: February 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started sub-section 39 - introduction to arrays. Completed 50% of the lecture, continuing tomorrow. Script and notes up-to-date so far. 

**Thoughts**: I had briefly covered arrays in previous courses, no issues so far. I'm looking forward to honing my understanding of arrays.


### Day 17: February 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 39 - introduction to arrays. Script and notes up-to-date. 

**Thoughts**: I had briefly covered arrays in previous courses, no issues so far. I'm looking forward to honing my understanding of arrays.


### Day 18: March 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 40 - Basic array operations (Methods). Script and notes up-to-date.

**Thoughts**: I had briefly covered array operations in previous courses, again, no issues so far. I'm confident in my ability to apply methods to my arrays.


(Break taken for medical reasons)


## Day 19: March 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-sections 41 - 43. Coding Challenge #2 of this section, Introduction to Objects and finally dot vs bracket notations.

**Thoughts**: I found coding challenge #2 to be a little difficult due to the break that I had taken and required a recap of previous lessons to complete. Objects are new to me, though I did find the lessons easy to follow and managed to complete a mini-coding challenge on objects without issue.  I feel that I need to re-familiarise myself with arrays and continue to research more in objects. I will achieve this by using other resources such a MDN.


## Day 20: April 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-sections 44 - 45. Coding Challenge #3 of this section and an introduction to Object methods.

**Thoughts**: I found the object methods lecture easy to follow and did not find myself having to repeat many sections except to take notes. Whilst I left the lecture feeling confident, I would like to further my knowledge on object methods to solidify that knowledge. As for the coding challenge, I managed to complete all challenges without difficulty, however, I did find myself having to return to the video to clarify how I would insert certain data in a template literal.


## Day 21: April 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 46. Iteration: the for loop.

**Thoughts**: Followed the lecture without issue and found it to be quite straight forward, I had previously covered loops in a past course. I will continue to further research for loops to see further use of this particular loop.


## Day 22: April 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 47. Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing.

**Thoughts**: I completed the lecture without any problems but, again, I feel that I can further develop my knowledge on this particular subject. I do not feel completely confident as of yet.


## Day 23: April 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 48. Looping backwards and loops in loops.

**Thoughts**: Again, I feel that I completed the lecture and followed along without difficulty. However, it is a subject that I'd like to develop more confidence in. I will further research this particular topic, especially loops inside of loops.


## Day 24: April 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 49 and coding challenge #4, the last of this section.

**Thoughts**: I completed the while loop lecture and followed along without any difficulty though I am not fully confident in my ability to use while loops appropriately. I completed the coding challenge in decent time, though I found myself stuck on the bonus challenge that required me to create a function that calculated the average of a sum of numbers in an array. I decided to re-do the challenge later to re-test myself and found that I was able to complete the challenge without issue. 

### 03-Fundamentals-Part-2 [COMPLETE]

### 05-Developer Skills and Editor Setup [START]
## Day 25: April 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Further configured VSCode for quality of life purposes. This included downloading an extension for VSCode called Prettier that formats and manages code. I then also set up my first User Snippet that automates typing console.log() through the use of abbreviated prefixes. Lastly, I downloaded another extension called TODOhighlight that can highlight certain prefixes, again just for QoL.

**Thoughts**: Followed the lecture and steps without any difficulty, VSCode has been set up according to the instructions that I followed during the lecture. However, I did get stuck for a significant period of time when trying to configure and customise TODO Highlight via the .json settings. Thankfully, I eventually found the issue and made the changes I wanted.


## Day 26: April 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I furthered configured my developer environment and installed a VSCode extension called 'Live Server' of which updates my browser console upon saving my code, removing the need to refresh my browser every time I save. I took this one step further and installed 'Nodejs' which essentially does the same thing as Live Server with the addition of terminal commands and more customisation.

**Thoughts**: The lecture was easy to follow though I had a few issues whilst installing Nodejs. I was informed of high severity warnings upon installation that I was unable to fix by following the in-terminal steps, though I'm still able to use Nodejs. I also had issues using Git when I closed a terminal performing tasks prematurely. This was resolved by deleting the index.lock file in the .git folder. I still need to find out which Node files are worth pushing to a repository on Github as for now I have not done so.


## Day 27: April 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed a few more sub-sections including 'Learning how to code' and 'How to think like a developer'

**Thoughts**: Not much to say here as the lectures mostly covered short presentations outlining common issues that new programmers face. I did however take a lot away from these 2 lectures in particular as I am now more selfaware of bad habits and practices that can easily be avoided. Definitely given me a fresher perspective.


## Day 28: May 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More developer skill sub sections 'Using Google, Stackoverflow and MDN' and 'Debugging (Fixing errors)'.

**Thoughts**: The first lecture essentially just covered using online resources to solve programming problems, which is something that I'm very familiar/confident with. The Debugging lecture was very informative and gave me a new way of looking at errors/bugs. The lecture covered an optimal way of tackling those errors using the Identify > Find > Fix > Prevent steps. 


## Day 29: May 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Following yesterday's lecture on Debugging, I completed sub section 'Debugging with the console and breakpoints' which dives deeper into finding and tackling errors more effectively using the console.

**Thoughts**: I can see that using the console and breakpoints effectively is certainly a skill in itself. I am not confident in using the console and breakpoints but I now have a broad idea as to how to use these tools to my advantage.


## Day 30: May 03, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed a Coding Challenge at the end of the Developer Skills and Editor setup section.

**Thoughts**: The coding challenge covered what had previously been learned in this section and emphasised on problem-solving. My first attempt at the challenge worked, however, it did not provide the *exact* result (function needed to output multiple strings on one single line, my code printed strings on a different line each iteration of loop). This was solved by creating an empty string variable and updating that string variable with each iteration of a loop. I enjoyed this challenge a lot and found myself going outside of the challenge requirements to further develop my function.
