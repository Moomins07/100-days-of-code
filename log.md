# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Having completed a variety of exercises from various different courses over the last few months, I have decided to begin a JavaScript Udemy course from scratch and it is my goal to complete the course in it's entirety by the end of my 100days-of-code challenge. I believe that, by doing so, I will not only streamline my learning experience, but I will also set myself a clear goal/path that is realistic within the time frame that I have set. I am coding along with my lecturer, taking notes and completing ALL of the coding challenges presented to me in the course. You can find my notes and code here: https://github.com/Moomins07/udemy-course-notes.

### Day 1: January 30, 2022 
### 01-Fundamentals-Part-1 [START]

**Today's Progress**: I completed 6-11 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. This took approximately 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts:** I have covered a lot of the basic fundamentals of JS before, however, this particular course went into much greater detail and filled in a few smaller knowledge gaps. I now have a greater understanding of JavaScript overall, including its origin, terminology such as the use of 'value', ES6 and what is considered 'modern JS'.


### Day 2: January 31, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I completed 12-16 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered data types, variables, basic operators, operator precedence and I also completed a coding challenge (#1) that entailed the use of all of the previously mentioned fundamentals. This took approximately 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Once again this particular course went into much greater detail on subjects/fundamentals I thought I already had an adequate understanding of and filled in smaller knowledge gaps I was unaware of. For example, |typeof null| returning |object| as opposed to |null| in the same way that |typeof undefined| returns |undefined|.


### Day 3: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 17-19 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered strings and template literals, if...else statements and a coding challenge (#2) that entailed the use of all of the previously mentioned fundamentals. This took approximately 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: Having covered string template literals and if...else statements in a previous course, I did not have any issues with these sub-sections. I did however learn that template literal strings can break/use multiple lines by simply using return, as opposed to using \n\. I will be using backtick quotes (`) for all of my strings from now on.


### Day 4: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 20-22 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered type conversion/coercion, truthy and falsy values and equality operators. This took approximately 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have studied these subjects briefly in a previous course and I did not have any trouble. I feel that I have further developed my understanding in all 3 subjects. However, loose equality operators are still somewhat of a grey area with room for improvement.

### Day 5: February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 23-25 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered boolean logic, logical operators and a coding challenge (#3) that entailed the use of all 3 subjects. This took approximately 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have covered boolean logic and logical opperators briefly in a previous course. I did not struggle with either subject and completed the coding challenge plus bonus challenges with little trouble, in good time, and also with final code very similar to my lecturer's. I believe that I have a good understanding of both subjects. I would like to further research common circumstances in which the NOT (!) operator is used.


### Day 6: February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 26-27 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered switch statements and statements & expressions. I re-wrote a switch statement as an if...else statement as a coding challenge. This took approximately 1.5 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have covered switch statements briefly in a previous course and I had little trouble with the coding challenge, completing it in good time. I was not entirely clear on the differences between statements and expressions and I found it to be a grey area before the lecture. However, I feel confident that I now have a greater understanding of both subjects.


### Day 7: February 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 28-30 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered ternary operators, a coding challenge putting ternary operators into practice and finally a history on JavaScript including a brief explanation of transpiling and polyfilling. Specifically, the coding challenge entailed the use of a ternary operator and recalling the value in a template literal. I have completed Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. This took approximately 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: Ternary operators are relatively new to me as I don't recall spending a significant amount of time on the subject in a previous course. However, I did not have any issues with following the lecture or completing the coding challenge. I found Section 30 on the history of JavaScript very interesting as I was not aware of its origin until today.

### 01-Fundamentals-Part-1 [COMPLETE]

 
### 01-Fundamentals-Part-2 [START]
### Day 8: February 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: My hour today was spent setting up the relevant files and completing subsection 32, 'activating strict mode' (first lecture of Fundamentals part 2) in which I learned about the benefits of using strict mode in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** All files and working environment is now prepared for the entirety of Fundamentals part 2. Activating strict mode in JavaScript is simple and hlds many benefits with very little downside to its use. I will be using strict mode for all of my scripts from now on.


### Day 9: February 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 50% of sub-section 33 of Section 3: Fundamentals - Part 2 on Functions. I've taken relevant notes and written a basic function that returns data to the console.

**Thoughts**: Even having only completed 50% of the first lecture on functions, I feel that I have already clarified various grey areas and developed a better understanding. However, the function lectures are siginificantly longer than previous subsection lectures.


### Day 10: February 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-section 33 of Section 3: Fundamentals - Part 2 on Functions. I've also started Function declarations vs Function expressons. I've taken relevant notes and written a basic function that returns data to the console.

**Thoughts**: After the completion of the lecture on functions, I feel much more confident and knowledgeable on the subject, enough so to continue forward with the course. However, I would definitely like to supplement my knowledge on functions further to concrete that knowledge.


### (Visiting family Feb 9 - Feb 21)


### Day 11: February 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-section 34 of Section 3: Fundamentals - Part 2 on Functions. Function declarations vs Function expressons completed.

**Thoughts**: I now know the difference between declarations and expressions as well as circumstances in which one may be more useful than the other.


### Day 12: February 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today was mostly a recap of previous lessons under Section 3 to re-familiarise myself after a long break. I also completed sub-section 35 'arrow functions'.

**Thoughts**: A lesson re-cap felt necessary and I also feel that I will likely re-cap more previous lessons under Section 2. I am not entirely confident on arrow functions yet, I will further research the topic and re-cap the lesson again tomorrow.


### Day 13: February 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed sub-sections 36-37 of Section 3 Fundamentals part 2. The topics covered were Functions calling other functions and reviewing functions.

**Thoughts**: I feel much more confident in my ability to use and understand functions. However, I certainly feel that I could further develop that knowledge and understanding.


### Day 14: February 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: As mentioned in yesterday's thought's log, I decided to spend today re-capping 'reviewing functions' and properly updating my notes on that lesson.

**Thoughts**: I feel that I have in fact further developed my knowledge on functions and now also have very useful notes that I can refer back to if need be.


### Day 15: February 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed the first coding challenge of Section 3 Fundamentals part 2. In the challenge, I was required to create multiple functions to fulfil certain tasks. This included using arrow functions, functions expressions, functions within functions and also an if-else statement. 

**Thoughts**: Having finally put the knowledge and studying to use has greatly increased my confidence in the use of functions. I feel condfident moving on.


### Day 16: February 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started sub-section 39 - introduction to arrays. Completed 50% of the lecture, continuing tomorrow. Script and notes up-to-date so far. 

**Thoughts**: I had briefly covered arrays in previous courses, no issues so far. I'm looking forward to honing my understanding of arrays.


### Day 17: February 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 39 - introduction to arrays. Script and notes up-to-date. 

**Thoughts**: I had briefly covered arrays in previous courses, no issues so far. I'm looking forward to honing my understanding of arrays.


### Day 18: March 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 40 - Basic array operations (Methods). Script and notes up-to-date.

**Thoughts**: I had briefly covered array operations in previous courses, again, no issues so far. I'm confident in my ability to apply methods to my arrays.


(Break taken for medical reasons)


## Day 19: March 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-sections 41 - 43. Coding Challenge #2 of this section, Introduction to Objects and finally dot vs bracket notations.

**Thoughts**: I found coding challenge #2 to be a little difficult due to the break that I had taken and required a recap of previous lessons to complete. Objects are new to me, though I did find the lessons easy to follow and managed to complete a mini-coding challenge on objects without issue.  I feel that I need to re-familiarise myself with arrays and continue to research more in objects. I will achieve this by using other resources such a MDN.


## Day 20: April 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-sections 44 - 45. Coding Challenge #3 of this section and an introduction to Object methods.

**Thoughts**: I found the object methods lecture easy to follow and did not find myself having to repeat many sections except to take notes. Whilst I left the lecture feeling confident, I would like to further my knowledge on object methods to solidify that knowledge. As for the coding challenge, I managed to complete all challenges without difficulty, however, I did find myself having to return to the video to clarify how I would insert certain data in a template literal.


## Day 21: April 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 46. Iteration: the for loop.

**Thoughts**: Followed the lecture without issue and found it to be quite straight forward, I had previously covered loops in a past course. I will continue to further research for loops to see further use of this particular loop.


## Day 22: April 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 47. Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing.

**Thoughts**: I completed the lecture without any problems but, again, I feel that I can further develop my knowledge on this particular subject. I do not feel completely confident as of yet.


## Day 23: April 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 48. Looping backwards and loops in loops.

**Thoughts**: Again, I feel that I completed the lecture and followed along without difficulty. However, it is a subject that I'd like to develop more confidence in. I will further research this particular topic, especially loops inside of loops.


## Day 24: April 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed sub-section 49 and coding challenge #4, the last of this section.

**Thoughts**: I completed the while loop lecture and followed along without any difficulty though I am not fully confident in my ability to use while loops appropriately. I completed the coding challenge in decent time, though I found myself stuck on the bonus challenge that required me to create a function that calculated the average of a sum of numbers in an array. I decided to re-do the challenge later to re-test myself and found that I was able to complete the challenge without issue. 

### 03-Fundamentals-Part-2 [COMPLETE]

## Section 04 N/A [Course navigation]

### 05-Developer Skills and Editor Setup [START]
## Day 25: April 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Further configured VSCode for quality of life purposes. This included downloading an extension for VSCode called Prettier that formats and manages code. I then also set up my first User Snippet that automates typing console.log() through the use of abbreviated prefixes. Lastly, I downloaded another extension called TODOhighlight that can highlight certain prefixes, again just for QoL.

**Thoughts**: Followed the lecture and steps without any difficulty, VSCode has been set up according to the instructions that I followed during the lecture. However, I did get stuck for a significant period of time when trying to configure and customise TODO Highlight via the .json settings. Thankfully, I eventually found the issue and made the changes I wanted.


## Day 26: April 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I furthered configured my developer environment and installed a VSCode extension called 'Live Server' of which updates my browser console upon saving my code, removing the need to refresh my browser every time I save. I took this one step further and installed 'Nodejs' which essentially does the same thing as Live Server with the addition of terminal commands and more customisation.

**Thoughts**: The lecture was easy to follow though I had a few issues whilst installing Nodejs. I was informed of high severity warnings upon installation that I was unable to fix by following the in-terminal steps, though I'm still able to use Nodejs. I also had issues using Git when I closed a terminal performing tasks prematurely. This was resolved by deleting the index.lock file in the .git folder. I still need to find out which Node files are worth pushing to a repository on Github as for now I have not done so.


## Day 27: April 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed a few more sub-sections including 'Learning how to code' and 'How to think like a developer'

**Thoughts**: Not much to say here as the lectures mostly covered short presentations outlining common issues that new programmers face. I did however take a lot away from these 2 lectures in particular as I am now more selfaware of bad habits and practices that can easily be avoided. Definitely given me a fresher perspective.


## Day 28: May 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More developer skill sub sections 'Using Google, Stackoverflow and MDN' and 'Debugging (Fixing errors)'.

**Thoughts**: The first lecture essentially just covered using online resources to solve programming problems, which is something that I'm very familiar/confident with. The Debugging lecture was very informative and gave me a new way of looking at errors/bugs. The lecture covered an optimal way of tackling those errors using the Identify > Find > Fix > Prevent steps. 


## Day 29: May 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Following yesterday's lecture on Debugging, I completed sub section 'Debugging with the console and breakpoints' which dives deeper into finding and tackling errors more effectively using the console.

**Thoughts**: I can see that using the console and breakpoints effectively is certainly a skill in itself. I am not confident in using the console and breakpoints but I now have a broad idea as to how to use these tools to my advantage.


## Day 30: May 03, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed a Coding Challenge at the end of the Developer Skills and Editor setup section.

**Thoughts**: The coding challenge covered what had previously been learned in this section and emphasised on problem-solving. My first attempt at the challenge worked, however, it did not provide the *exact* result (function needed to output multiple strings on one single line, my code printed strings on a different line each iteration of loop). This was solved by creating an empty string variable and updating that string variable with each iteration of a loop. I enjoyed this challenge a lot and found myself going outside of the challenge requirements to further develop my function.

### 05-Developer Skills and Editor Setup [COMPLETE]


## Day 30-37: May 10-17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: During this time, I decided to re-familiarise myself and re-complete every coding challenge that I had faced in the course until now. 

**Thoughts**: Re-completing the coding challenges very eye-opening for me. Some of the challenges still had me stuck for a small period of time, as I had forgotten a few basic concepts. However, I was able to overcome every coding challenge whilst also further developing my code and in fact making it more efficient. I was then able to compare the code I was able to produce now with the previously written coding challenges. 


### 06-HTML & CSS Crash course [START]
## Day 38: May 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed sub-setions 63, 64 and 65. This included a section intro, basic html structure & elements and lastly attributes, classes and IDs.

**Thoughts**: Previous to beginning this Udemy course, I had spent a significant amount of time using HTML and CSS. I am very familiar with these subjects and I did not spend longer than necessary on this section. There were a few concepts I had forgotten and this short crash course once again has me up to speed.


## Day 39: May 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed the last 2 sub-sections of the HTML crash course 66 & 67 which included basic styling with CSS and Introduction to the CSS box model.

**Thoughts**: Again, I am very familiar with HTML and CSS and I did not have any issues following the lectures. There were once again a few syntax that I had forgotten about such as border-box. The lecturer kept this section very brief.

### 06-HTML & CSS Crash course [COMPLETE]


### 07-JavaScript in the Browser: DOM and Events Fundamentals   [START]
## Day 40: May 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 68 - 71 which included 'section intro', 'section roadmap', 'PROJECT#1 Guess my number!' and 'What's the DOM & DOM manipulation'.

**Thoughts**: Having spent the last few months mostly focussing on the application of fundamentals in VSCode, it's a breath of fresh air to finally see my code applied to something that I can visually see working in the DOM. It's a very basic project that uses simple logic wherein the user has to try and guess a pre-determined number between 1-100. The user will then be told if the number is too low, too high or correct. There is also a simple score counter that reduces by 1 from 20 every time the user guesses incorrectly. So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about the DOM and manipulation in the DOM.


## Day 41: May 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 72 & 73 which included 'Selecting and Manipulating Elements' and 'Handling Click Events'.

**Thoughts**: Again, focussing on the Guess my number game, the lecturer went into further detail as to how to select certain elements on the page and how we may go about manipulating that element. I have now also began to use the eventListener method, allowing the user to interact with the webpage and to produce a reaction from that event. Fun stuff!


## Day 42: June 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-section 74 'Implementing the game logic'.

**Thoughts**: This was a particularly fun lecture as I finally began to code the logic into the number guessing game. This entailed using if-else statements and also required me to use an if statement within an if-else statement for the first time. Overall, a very enjoyable lesson.


## Day 43: June 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 75 & 76 'Manipulating CSS styles' and 'Coding Challenge #1'.

**Thoughts**: In the first lecture, I learned how to make changes to the styling of the webpage through the use of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. Quite a straight forward lecture, fun to see visual changes being made to the website through eventListeners.
Secondly, I completed a Coding Challenge wherein I was asked to create a 'reset' button for the game. Essentially I was required to restore initial values, such as clearing the form input box and resetting the score. No issues here, completed quite quickly.


## Day 44: June 07, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 77, 78 and 79. 'Implementing highscores', 'Refactoring our code, DRY principle' and 'Project #2: Modal window'.

**Thoughts**: Implementing highscores was quite straight forward in the fact that it was essentially applying typical if-else logic to ensure that the highscore persisted through game resets too. 'Refactoring our code' was a very interesting lecture as it delved into much greater detail with regards to 'Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY)', which entailed taking repeated code and placing it in a function. Lastly, Project#2 Modal window was a very fun, and very important lecture as it was the first glimpse at using classList to add, remove and even toggle CSS classes on certain DOM elements. Overall, I found all of the lectures very enjoyable and easy to follow. 


## Day 45: June 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 80 and 81. 'Working with classes' & "Handling an 'Esc' Keypress event".

**Thoughts**: Learning to make the website interactable is very enjoyable. In 'Working with classes', I learned how to use classList to both remove and add a class to an element to achieve the required effect. I need to remember that when using classList, I did not need to add a dot/fullstop at the beginning of the class name. 
E.g. "hidden" NOT ".hidden". In the "Handling an 'Esc' Keypress event" lecture, I learned how to make an element react to a keypress, or more specifically, a 'keydown' event. The most important piece of information that I learned during this lecture is how to specifically tell JavaScript which key we want it to execute on by using and accessing the event handler function. Obviously, I have not even scratched the surface as to the possibilities using the event handler function.


## Day 46: June 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 82, 83 and 84. 'Project #3: Pig Game', 'Rolling the Dice' and 'Switching the Active Player'.

**Thoughts**: There was a lot to cover in these 3 lectures and it took a significant amount of time to complete them. In 'Project #3: Pig game', I covered the overall game concept, logic/pseudo code and certain code statements. I have now begun to store querySelectors/getElementById in variables to make recalling them easier and code cleaner. 'Rolling the Dice' was a fun lecture. It was during this lecture that I coded the functionality of the dice rolling using a flow chart to better understand what is required. E.g. My notes state the following: 
Step 1: Generate random number.
Step 2: Display that Dice number.
Step 3: Roll conditions.
Much easier to follow!
Lastly, 'Switching the Active Player' was more complex as I stored the 'players' in an Array as player 0 and player 1 due to Arrays being 0-based. It was also in this lecture that I've begun to see just how useful template literals are and the potential they have to make code easier and cleaner. I certainly haven't retained all of the information in this lecture but it's been a very educational one regardless.


## Day 47: June 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 85 & 86. 'Holding Current Score' and ' Resetting the Game'.

**Thoughts**: In 'Holding the Current Score', I have begun to comment my code more in a way that I'm breaking down what I want the function to do in steps before I start adding code. The rest of the lecture was mostly coding logic and refactoring our code. I also used a Boolean here for the first time to disallow the user from interacting with the game when a winner is declared. 'Resetting the Game' was more of a coding challenge than it was a lecture as I was required to code the conditions to bring the game back to its 'starting conditions'. It was during this lecture that I declared empty global variables for the first time due to scope.

### 07-JavaScript in the Browser: DOM and Events Fundamentals   [COMPLETE]


### 08-How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes   [START]
## Day 48: June 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections [87, 88 (Section intro and roadmap)], 89, 90 and 91. 'A High-Level Overview of JavaScript', 'The JavaScript Engine and Runtime' and 'Execution Contexts and The Call Stack'.

**Thoughts**: I am excited to further my understanding and knowledge of JavaScript with the upcoming theory lectures, but there was a lot of information to retain during these lectures. 
In 'A High Level Overview of JavaScript' the lecturer briefly explains a variety of topics related to the functionality of JavaScript, such as what 'high level' means. Progressively in the following two lectures, sections 90 and 91, the lecturer begins to explain the topics mentioned in the first lecture in greater detail. I am using flash cards to help retain the information that I have learned during these lectures. I definitely have a better understanding as to how JavaScript works behind the scenes, I just hope I remember all of the information!


## Day 49: June 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 92 & 93. 'Scope and The Scope Chain' and 'Scoping in Practice'.

**Thoughts**: I can see just how important it is for a developer to have a greater understanding of the Scope Chain in JavaScript, especially since there are very subtle but important changes to the scope that can occur. As for scoping, I will absolutely return to my notes and re-watch the lectures to ensure that I have solidified my understanding of the scope as I am not entirely confident. Overall, I have a much better understanding as to how Scoping works, but I feel that I can further my knowledge and become even more confident on the subject.


## Day 50: June 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 94 & 95. 'Variable Environment: Hoisting and The TDZ' and 'Hoisting and TDZ in Practice'.

**Thoughts**: It is clear that an understanding of 'Hoisting and The TDZ' is important. It is a lecture that I will return to in the future, but I am confident now however that I won't ever be using 'var' to declare my variables! 'TDZ in practice' really displayed just how finicky JS can be when it comes to hoisting. I feel confident on the subject, but as mentioned above, I will be returning to the lectures to further solidify my understanding.

## [Please note that around this time, I have begun to spend less time taking notes and spend more time commenting my code in place of. Refer to script.js in the 'starter' folders.]

## Day 51: June 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 96, 97 and 98. 'The this Keyword', 'The this Keyword in Practice' & 'Regular Functions vs. Arrow Functions'.

**Thoughts**: I have a much better understanding of the 'this' keyword, but I am by no means confident on its use, especially when used with arrow functions due to its interaction with the scope. In 'Regular functions vs. Arrow Functions', I essentially learned that it is generally best practice not to use an arrow function for a method, as arrow functions don't have access to their own 'this' keyword. Again, I am not confident and I will return to the lectures in the future.


## Day 52: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed sub-sections 99 & 100. 'Primitives vs Objects (Primitives vs. Reference Types)' & 'Primitives vs. Objects in Practice'.

**Thoughts**: Both of these lectures were extremely interesting as I finally learned about the Call Stack and Heap in greater detail. I now understand that an object is stored and called from the heap using a reference to that piece of memory in the heap. (Hence reference type). This is why we cannot simply just copy an object into a new identifier and make changes, it's still the same reference. We have to use the 'assign' method to copy at a 'shallow level'. Overall, although I am not entirely confident on all the subjects covered in this section, I am very happy with my progress so far.

### 08-How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes   [COMPLETE]

## [PC brokedown for several weeks]
## [Hand injury followed]

### 09-Data Structures, Modern Operators and Strings    [START]
## Day 53: July 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed sub-sections 101, 102 & 103 - Destructuring Arrays.
I used destructuring to assign variables to returned values from an object method, assign variables to nested array elements, and also learned how to use destructuring to set 'default values'.

**Thoughts**: I followed the lecture without any issues, it's very clear to see how useful and important destructuring will be as it greatly simplified the solution process to assigning and re-assigning variables from array elements. Though I was confident following the lecture, I am not confident in my ability to use destructuring where appropriate.


## Day 54: July 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed sub-section 104 - Destructuring Objects.
I used destructuring to assign variables to object properties, to set default values, to mutate variables, to destructure nested objects and most importantly I learned how to destructure using functions.

**Thoughts**: I felt that I followed the lesson quite smoothly until I approached destructuring with functions. I am not confident in my ability to use functions to destructure an object, but I can see how useful doing so will be, so that I am able to get a good idea as to how many parameters a function may need. Overall, there was a lot of information in this lecture and I will absolutely need to return to it in the future.

## Switched to C# course for upcoming opportunity.
## Day 55: July 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the first 2 modules of the "Take your first steps with C#" course. "Write your first C# code" and "Store and retrieve data using literal and variable values in C#". More importantly I learned how to declare variables in C#, as well as the various data types, vastly different from JavaScript as C# is not a dynamic language.

**Thoughts**: Having spent a significant amount of time just learning JavaScript, it's very fun to learn a new language, especially a language such as C# that is a lw-level language. Overall, I found the course easy to follow and very enjoyable although I will have to adjust slightly as my previous JS lectures have mostly been through visual videos.


## Day 56: July 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed 2 more modules of the "Take your first steps with C#" course. "Perform basic string formatting in C#" and "Perform basic operations on numbers in C#". Topics to note are learning to use verbatim literal strings, template literals (string interpolation) and how to combine the two. In the operations module, I learned about the order of execution in mathematical equations (PEMDAS) and implicit type coercion.

**Thoughts**: There are a lot of similarities between JavaScript and C#. It's very enjoyable to start a new language and to be able to apply knowledge that I've gained whilst learning JavaScript. It is because of this that I can spend significantly less time on these lessons, and even less time taking notes. I feel however that I have once again spent much too long on notes and need to greatly reduce the time even further spent doing so.


## Still progressing with JavaScript course.
## Day 57: July 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Following from Day 54, I have completed sections 105 & 106. The Spread Operator(...) and Rest Pattern and parameters. I learned to use the spread operator in a variety of ways, such as generally unpacking elements in an array, merging arrays, function arguments, and also even copying arrays/objects on a shallow level. In the Rest pattern lecture, I learned the difference between spread/rest, as they use the same syntax. Most importantly, as the rest pattern comes before assignment, I learned how to use it in destructuring.

**Thoughts**: I remember once briefly coming across this magical syntax and wondering how it worked and why it made certain coding solutions so much easier. It's very clear to see just how game-changing both the spread operator and rest pattern are to coding. It's the kind of knowledge that boosts my motivation to dive deeper.


## Day 58: July 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed sections 107, 108, 109 and 110, 'Short Circuiting (&& and ||)', 'The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)', 'Logical Assignment Operators' and lastly a coding challenge. There was a lot of information to go through today, it was quite overwhelming and I definitely have not retained everything. However, I was able to complete the coding challenge at the end without too many issues. 

**Thoughts**: Overall, today's lectures were extremely informative and is beginning to change the way I see my code entirely. I did not find the lectures too difficult to follow and left most lectures feeling ready to begin the next, but I certainly do not feel confident in my ability to see most cases in which I would use destructuring or logical assignments. Points to note: During the coding challenge, I forgot to destructure an array using [] and instead destructured the array using {}, obviously this did not work as intended. I also overcomplicated a function that just needed to print ${players.length}, ...players being the function parameter with spread operator; I made a loop that iterated the length of players and continuously added 1 to a goals variable.


## Day 59: July 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided that I'd begin supplementing my Udemy course with project-based learning. To start, I decided to re-do a console-based rock, paper, scissior game that I coded around 6 months ago, of which you can find in my GitHub repo. This time, I decided to also create a GUI. I also managed to complete the logic of the game to an extent that I felt happy with. However, this did take around 5-6 hours of non-stop coding.

**Thoughts**: I am happy with the result, as I did manage to make the GUI look 'decent' whilst getting the game to run as intended. I definitely need to code more projects, as I felt very rusty and found myself struggling to write what I had considered rather basic code. I got stuck for around 2-3 hours as a piece of logic was not working as intended, I struggled to locate the bug but eventually found that it was due to a global variable being on ther wrong side of an assignment operator, and so the variable was returning as undefined. Such a simple mistake cost a huge amount of time and frustration, but I eentually managed. Except for that hiccup, the rest of the logic did not take too long, in fact I think the styling took longer as I experimented with hover-over animations to make the buttons fancier!


## Day 60: July 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I have begun to re-familiarise myself with TOP (The Odin Project), which is an online course that focuses heavily on project-based learning. The course uses Nodejs and JavaScript which is of course the language that I have chosen to learn and focus on. To start, I went back through the Foundations course, found an exercise repo that I forked earlier this year and worked back through those exercises.

**Thoughts**: Note that the exercises completed today focused on HTML and CSS. It was a lot of fun to go back through exercises that I completed half a year ago, especially as I recall doing them and specifically remember getting stuck on several. Although I was re-familiarising myself with a lot of the HTML/CSS from half a year ago, I found myself completing the exercises with little to no issues. In fact, I completed several folders of exercises in a single evening. Very happy with today's progress, certainly in a better position to begin more projects.


## Day 61: July 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to re-familiarising myself with TOP, part of the curriculum required me to create a RPS game in the console. 
I originally completed this back in January 2022 using a lot of guidance:
https://github.com/Moomins07/rock-paper-scissors
However, I decided to re-create the same project from scratch with extra functionality with little to no guidance. I completed the project in just over an hour.

**Thoughts**: It was a lot of fun to re-create this project, especially as I recall how much I had struggled with the original project back in January. 
This time around, I used pseudo-code and added extra functionality, such as a while loop that would re-prompt the user if the input did not match the if statements conditions. I also played around with short-circuiting and managed to do so successfully. Other notes: I'm also commenting my code more, I'm placing more code in functions and using global variables more often. The only global code is 4 variables and a function that is invoked to begin the game. Overall, I'm very happy with the result, especially as I did not feel the need to use guidance or docs!


## Day 62: July 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with TOP, I've now moved on to Test Driven Development (TDD). I'm required to complete several exercises wherein I must create functions that meet certain test requirements. I completed most of the exercises today, within around 5-6 hours, but I still have several left.

**Thoughts**: The TDD section has been, by far, the most challenging so far and I found myself getting stuck on a lot of the coding challenges. Specifically, I got stuck on a challenge that required me to create a function that is capable of removing multiple elements from an array for several hours; so far, I have only managed to make this function complete 2 out of the 7 test requirements. I achieved this by looping through a rest parameter array and using the splice()/indexOf method. Whilst it was very demoralizing to be stuck on one coding challenge for multiple hours, I perservered and managed to get some of the tests to pass, a bitter sweet victory. I am looking forward to hopefully getting all the tests to pass tomorrow.
