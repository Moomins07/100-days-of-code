# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Having completed a variety of exercises from various different courses over the last few months, I have decided to begin a JavaScript Udemy course from scratch and it is my goal to complete the course in it's entirety by the end of my 100days-of-code challenge. I believe that, by doing so, I will not only streamline my learning experience, but I will also set myself a clear goal/path that is realistic within the time frame that I have set. I am coding along with my lecturer, taking notes and completing ALL of the coding challenges presented to me in the course.

### Day 1: January 30, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I completed 6-11 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. This took approximately 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts:** I have covered a lot of the basic fundamentals of JS before, however, this particular course went into much greater detail and filled in a few smaller knowledge gaps. I now have a greater understanding of JavaScript overall, including its origin, terminology such as the use of 'value', ES6 and what is considered 'modern JS'.


### Day 2: January 31, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I completed 12-16 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered data types, variables, basic operators, operator precedence and I also completed a coding challenge (#1) that entailed the use of all of the previously mentioned fundamentals. This took approximately 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Once again this particular course went into much greater detail on subjects/fundamentals I thought I already had an adequate understanding of and filled in smaller knowledge gaps I was unaware of. For example, |typeof null| returning |object| as opposed to |null| in the same way that |typeof undefined| returns |undefined|.


### Day 3: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 17-19 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered strings and template literals, if...else statements and a coding challenge (#2) that entailed the use of all of the previously mentioned fundamentals. This took approximately 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: Having covered string template literals and if...else statements in a previous course, I did not have any issues with these sub-sections. I did however learn that template literal strings can break/use multiple lines by simply using return, as opposed to using \n\. I will be using backtick quotes (`) for all of my strings from now on.


### Day 4: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 20-22 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered type conversion/coercion, truthy and falsy values and equality operators. This took approximately 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have studied these subjects briefly in a previous course and I did not have any trouble. I feel that I have further developed my understanding in all 3 subjects. However, loose equality operators are still somewhat of a grey area with room for improvement.

### Day 5: February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed 23-25 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. The sub-sections covered boolean logic, logical operators and a coding challenge (#3) that entailed the use of all 3 subjects. This took approximately 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have covered boolean logic and logical opperators briefly in a previous course. I did not struggle with either subject and completed the coding challenge plus bonus challenges with little trouble, in good time, and also with final code very similar to my lecturer's. I believe that I have a good understanding of both subjects. I would like to further research common circumstances in which the NOT (!) operator is used.
