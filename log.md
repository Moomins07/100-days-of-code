# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Having completed a variety of exercises from various different courses over the last few months, I have decided to begin a JavaScript Udemy course from scratch and it is my goal to complete the course in it's entirety by the end of my 100days-of-code challenge. I believe that, by doing so, I will not only streamline my learning experience, but I will also set myself a clear goal/path that is realistic within the time frame that I have set. I am coding along with my lecturer, taking notes and completing ALL of the coding challenges presented to me in the course.

### Day 1: January 30, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I completed 6-11 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. This took approximately 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts:** I have covered a lot of the basic fundamentals of JS before, however, this particular course went into much greater detail and filled in a few smaller knowledge gaps. I now have a greater understanding of JavaScript overall, including its origin, terminology such as the use of 'value', ES6 and what is considered 'modern JS'.

### Day 2: January 31, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I completed 12-16 sub-sections of Section 2: Fundamentals - Part 1. This took approximately 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Once again this particular course went into much greater detail on subjects/fundamentals I thought I already had an adequate understanding of and filled in smaller knowledge gaps I was unaware of. Today covered data types, variables, basic operators, operator precedence and I also completed a coding challenge that entailed the use of all of the previously mentioned fundamentals.
